# Team Profile Generator

## Description 

This is an application to create a webpage for a development team you may be building. The application used the command line, node, express, and the npm package inquirer(@8.4.2) to dynamically create this page based on the questions you answer after running the program. Working through this project I learned much more and now feel comfortable with testing. Building off of ideas from previous projects and using the various helpful resources of the bootcamp, I feel I have learned quite a lot from this project.
